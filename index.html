            <span class="content">Couple of days ago, you were at the European summit. And then, of course, you were in Davos where you met [snorts] that one and only uh Donald G. Trump before we moved to that future of Europe.</span>

            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">We agreed not a comment on the meeting. So I should uh stick to my word.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">We're not really in a confidential environment uh I'm afraid but it was of course a very special experience as we had asked for the bilateral long beforehand and our king wanted to speak to Donald Trump about a certain subject.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So, he was a little bit uh dismayed um because he doesn't like to be contradicted. You might have noticed that.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">And of course, we are Europeans, which means we are very civilized. We're not so direct in speaking. But nevertheless, >> you called.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">>> I did not call him a monster. I said when the old is dying and if Atlantism would die I don't I also love America for us it was religious at home we had a portrait of Ronald Reagan in a crucifix and my father prayed I always wondered who is you actually praying to that that's where I'm coming from I'm the most pro-American guy you can find but it needs two to tango in a marriage you need to love each other and if Atlantism comes to an end globalization will go with it and we will be the victim of it and of course if you are threatened with violence</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So, we nicely, politely delivered the message. This I can say. I will not say how we reacted to it.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">Uh but I don't think I will get invited to the White House uh in the very near future.</span>

            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">Let's leave it at that. >> Okay, that's that that's clear.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">Um, one of your quotes, um, that was public, uh, and went all over the world was, "Being a happy vessel is one thing. Being a miserable slave is another about Europe and that transatlantic relation. How do you feel now? Really? Okay. >> As a happy vessel or a miserable slave, is that the question?"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">Well, that is the question, of course. Um, Trump is not wrong about everything. We have been freeloading.</span>

            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">We had won the cold war and we all thought liberal democracy will engulf the world and we will wake up in at the end of history even and so no more military expenses are needed and we became addicted to that logic.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So the burden shift of America turning its face towards the Pacific and of course the rival that is China is a very logical and a very structural thing.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">This will not change after Trump. But Trump added something another layer to it because Obama already urged us to do what we needed to and we didn't do it.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>

            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">On the other side we were addicted to cheap fossil oil flowing in from Russia because I have some reservations at what the commissioner said I must say about our transition towards sustainability and competitivity.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">I have reservations but the truth is we were also addicted to the cheap fossils and with the war in Ukraine those also got cut off.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">>> China is profitering from the war. They getting the cheap oil, the cheap gas. Uh, America is no longer supporting Ukraine.</span>

            <span class="content">They're selling us the arms. And we are stuck with bills, crazy energy prices.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So, we're financing a war with no strategy. We're giving money to Ukraine out nonfaraoh. We don't have the iron.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So, we give the we give the gold. But to do what exactly to keep that war going for >> what should we do then exactly concerning energy because you say well I disagree a bit with uh what Mr. Hookress says >> I don't dare to disagree with the European Commission but >> but there there's always there there's always a butt.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">I think that competitivity, productivity, innovation are the three horses. Sustainability in the green deal that's the carriage.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">And I have the impression that with the cheap fossils coming in from Russia and depending on the big stick, the guy with the big stick was with the United States who has shown us now that he can use the big stick against us.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">And that's a pivotal moment. >> That's a pivotal this we have never seen. That he no longer does what we want. Okay.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">But that he dares to threaten us with the big stick. That's a it is a pivotal moment.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">So now we see all our weaknesses and we must admit maybe we put the carriage before the three horses and made life extremely complicated with environmental rules that make it impossible to provide in our own energy needs that make it impossible to mine for rare minerals in Europe.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
            <span class="content">Uh we have no military capacity to provide for them elsewhere. Africa, Chinese are everywhere. South America, Africa, we are we are nowhere.</span>

        <div class="transcript-line">
            <span class="source-tag"></span>
